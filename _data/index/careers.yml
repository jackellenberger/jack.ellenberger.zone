      Signed on as a Support Developer, tasked with helping Product developers test, release, and communicate their changes to both users and other developers. The largest portion of this work was integrating backend changes with the six Server SDKs that Braintree provides, in Java, .NET, Python, Ruby, Node, and PHP. In addition, C++, web, and mobile APIs were maintained and upgraded to allow for a "drop-in" payment experience. <br/><br/>
      Also handled migrations of customer's personal and payment information into and out of the Braintree payment system, which often included programming new adapters depending on format and data layout. Too often it also included scolding others for their blatent misuses of GPG.
